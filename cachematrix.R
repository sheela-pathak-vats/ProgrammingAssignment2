## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
# to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The
# following two functions are used to cache the inverse of a matrix.

# makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix
# 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
   inv <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
        getInverse <- function() inv
        list(set = set,
             get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)

}


# The following function returns the inverse of the matrix. It first checks if
# the inverse has already been computed. If so, it gets the result and skips the
# computation. If not, it computes the inverse, sets the value in the cache via
# setinverse function.

# This function assumes that the matrix is always invertible.


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
       
	        inv <- x$getInverse()
	        if (!is.null(inv)) {
	                message("getting cached data")
	                return(inv)
	        }
	        mat <- x$get()
	        inv <- solve(mat, ...)
	        x$setInverse(inv)
        inv
